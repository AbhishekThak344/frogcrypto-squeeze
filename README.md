# 🐸 FrogCrypto Squeeze ($RIBBIT) - The First Amphibian-Powered DeFi Protocol

> *Warning: This is a parody project for educational purposes only*

## 🌟 Overview

FrogCrypto Squeeze ($RIBBIT) is a groundbreaking DeFi protocol that implements revolutionary "Lily Pad Staking™" and "Pond Liquidity™" mechanisms. Our proprietary "Frog Squeeze™" technology ensures that every time a paper-hands trader sells, their tokens are permanently locked in the Eternal Pond Vault™.

## 🔥 Core Mechanics

- **Lily Pad Staking™**: The longer you stake, the higher you jump
- **Pond Liquidity™**: Like regular liquidity pools, but with frogs
- **Frog Squeeze™**: Each sell creates more pressure, making $RIBBIT more scarce
- **Meta-Amphibian NFTs**: Randomly generated frogs with rare traits like "Diamond Tongue" and "Moon Legs"
- **Cross-Chain Tadpoles**: Revolutionary breeding mechanism across multiple blockchains

## 🛠 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekThak344/frogcrypto-squeeze
cd frogcrypto-squeeze
yarn install
yarn ribbit
```

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {

        // Paper hands tax
        if (lastJump[msg.sender] + 1 days > block.timestamp) {
            uint256 taxAmount = amount * 42 / 100; // 42% paper hands tax
            amount = amount - taxAmount;
            _transfer(msg.sender, address(this), taxAmount); // Goes to Eternal Pond
        }
        
        lastJump[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
        return super.transfer(to, amount);
    }

    // Lily Pad Staking
    function stakeOnLilyPad() external {
        lilyPadLevel[msg.sender] += 1;
        // The longer you stake, the greener your frog becomes
    }
}
```
